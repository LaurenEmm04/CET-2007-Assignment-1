# CET 2007 Assignment 1

In this project, I have created a working Player manager system with the ability to create new players, add stats (high score and hours played), log new games and add stats to certain games as well as a functional leaderboard with the ability to sort via high score or hours played with the option to filter by games chosen if you wish.

## Important Information
As you can see, there are multiple folders in here. Please follow these instructions to find the code your looking for.

When i started making the program, I unknowingly made it using .NET 8.0. I realised when it came to testing that my fully working program will not test using the testing class instructed. To fix this, I created a new solution in the same project, named it NET CET 2007 Assignment 1 (the code for it is in the folder ConsoleApp1, I apologise for it not having a name, I was unsure if I was able to fix it at the time, and by the time I did, the filepaths relied on the folder staying named ConsoleApp1)

All commits are still available for the older NET 8.0 version. The folder the code is in is CET 2007 Assignment 1. Again, this is the old version.
You can access the Commit history [Here](https://pages.github.com/).

The best way to navigate this programs creation is through the commit history. Due to the number of files (and the attempts I made to convert it to .NET framework 4.7.2) The CET2007_NET472VERSION folder may not be in use, but I attempted to delete it previously and my program broke entirely, therefore it must stay.

## My program. What and why i made it this way.
